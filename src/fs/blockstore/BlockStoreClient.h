// BlockStoreClient removed.
// Previously this file provided a thin local adapter to forward
// block operations (read/write/allocate/free) to a Volume found
// via IVolumeRegistry. It has been removed; use `VolumeManager`,
// `Volume` and `IVolumeRegistry` directly instead.

// Intentionally left as a marker to avoid accidental reintroduction.

// If needed in the future, you can see it in ZBStorage_old_yjy.
